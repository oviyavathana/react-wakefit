         <h6 className="mt-4">XXI.  NO COST EMI OFFER</h6>
         <p className="mb-5">
            For the purpose of these terms and conditions, wherever the context so requires, "you" and "your" shall relate to any<br /> natural or legal person who has opted for payment in equated monthly installments ("EMI") pursuant to payments made<br /> by credit cards ("EMI Offer") for making any purchase(s) on Wakefit.<br /><br />
            By availing the EMI Offer, you are agreeing to and accept the terms and conditions set out herein:
         <ul>
            <li>The EMI Offer is being offered uniformly, on all the products listed on the Wakefit Website. The EMI Offer does not<br /> amount to a waiver by any bank or financial institution on the interest component of the equated monthly<br /> installments being paid by you. However, this interest charge has been provided to you as an upfront discount at the<br /> time of your purchase, effectively giving you the benefit of a No Cost EMI</li>
            <li>You agree and confirm that you will need to pay applicable EMI and interest on the total value of the order at the<br /> time of payment to the bank, in accordance with the terms applicable to the credit card through which you undertake<br /> the transaction.</li>
            <li>The discretion to process payment lies with the bank that has issued the credit card being used by you for the<br /> transaction. Wakefit will have no obligation or liability in the event the bank refuses to process the transaction, for<br /> any reason whatsoever</li>
            <li>You agree that in the event you fail to make timely payments of EMI, there may be additional interests or penalties<br /> which may be levied by the bank, and you shall be solely liable to pay any such additional interests and penalties,<br /> if any</li>
            <li>The EMI Offer is currently valid for EMIs having a tenure of 3 (three) months and 6 (six) months only. The EMI Offer is<br /> facilitated by selected banks only, as displayed on the No Cost EMI Offer page</li>
            <li>The minimum cart value to avail the EMI Offer payment option is INR 10,000 (Rupees Ten Thousand Only)</li>
            <li>Any returns or cancellations will be as per Wakefit’s returns and cancellation policy, available for viewing on the<br /> Website. In the event of any return of the product for which payment was made using the EMI Offer ("Purchased<br /> Product"), or refund of the amount paid by you pursuant to the EMI Offer in an EMI transaction, the interest already<br /> charged by the relevant bank will NOT be refundable</li>
            <li>Wakefit will not charge a processing fee for availing the EMI Offer. However, the relevant bank may charge processing<br /> fees or cancellation charges as per their internal policies. Such charges shall be paid by you to the relevant bank and<br /> Wakefit will have no liability or obligation to refund such charges in the event of return of the Purchased Product or<br /> cancellation of the orders placed on the Website</li>
            <li>We request you to consult your bank or card issuer on the mechanics of cancellations, refunds or pre-closures<br /> affecting the terms of the EMI offered, and the details of the interest or cancellation charges that may be levied for<br /> the same</li>
            <li>Wakefit retains the right to modify or cancel these terms and conditions and the EMI Offer at its sole discretion at any<br /> time with no further notice</li>
            <li>You understand and agree that there may be a constraint on the number of transactions or purchases on a specific<br /> credit card, based on the transaction limits set by the issuing bank. You confirm that you shall abide by the terms and<br /> conditions as may be applicable on the credit<br /> card being used by you.</li>
            <li>You may be charged GST or other applicable taxes by your bank for the transactions undertaken using the credit cards issued by such bank</li>
